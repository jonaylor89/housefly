# Housefly: A Hands-On Web Scraping Playground

Housefly is an interactive learning project designed to teach web scraping through structured challenges. Each chapter includes a companion website built specifically to be scraped, allowing you to practice in a controlled environment.

## Features

* Realistic Web Scraping Challenges â€“ Work with purpose-built websites.
* Structured Learning â€“ Progress through guided exercises.
* Automated Solution Checking â€“ Verify your scrapers against expected outputs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housefly.git
cd housefly
```

2. Navigate to Chapter 1

Each chapter contains a simple website to scrape, along with an expected.txt file defining the correct output.

3. Write Your Scraper

Implement your solution inside the corresponding solution{number}/ directory.

4. Check Your Answer

Run the validation script to compare your scraperâ€™s output against expected.txt:

```sh
npm run ca 1
```

## Roadmap

- [x] basic single html file
- [ ] basic single html with structured text
- [ ] basic single html but with dynamic javascript content
    - [ ] pupeteer or playwright
- [ ] basic single html file with unstructured text needing structure (AI)
    - [ ] storing data and duplicates (index of URL -> data)
- [ ] multiple pages all within the same subdomain and path prefix (/content/*)
    - [ ] sitemap + link crawling
- [ ] random websites with different path structure and unstructured data needing structure
- [ ] random topic with unknown websites (perplexity style) crawl of unstructured data needing structure
    - [ ] searxng
