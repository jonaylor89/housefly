# Housefly: A Hands-On Web Scraping Playground

Housefly is an interactive learning project designed to teach web scraping through structured challenges. Each chapter includes a companion website built specifically to be scraped, allowing you to practice in a controlled environment.

## Features

* Realistic Web Scraping Challenges â€“ Work with purpose-built websites.
* Structured Learning â€“ Progress through guided exercises.
* Automated Solution Checking â€“ Verify your scrapers against expected outputs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonaylor89/housefly.git
cd housefly
```

2. Navigate to Chapter 1

Each chapter contains a simple website to scrape, along with an `expected.txt` file defining the correct output.

3. Write Your Scraper

Implement your solution inside the corresponding `solution{number}/` directory.

4. Check Your Answer

Run the validation script to compare your scraperâ€™s output against expected.txt:

```sh
# npx install playwright (optionally for some exercises)
npm run ca 1
```

5. Add Env Vars (Optional)

Some of the challenges require 3rd party apis e.g. OpenAI and for those, there is a `.env.template` file that you can fill in and rename to `.env` to use them

```
mv .env.template .env
```
