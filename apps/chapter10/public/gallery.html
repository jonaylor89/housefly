        <p>
          Browse our curated collection of historical images. Each image
          contains valuable metadata including descriptive alt text and
          meaningful filenames. Challenge: Extract image sources, alt text,
          filenames, and captions from this gallery.

          <h3 style="color: #1a3c5a; margin-top: 0;">OSINT Challenge: Publication Date Verification</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Was this gallery actually created on the date claimed?</strong> The website footer states this archive is from 1941, and the articles claim to be from April 15, 2023. Can this be true?
          </p>
          <p>
            In digital forensics and OSINT investigations, verifying publication dates is crucial. While CMS platforms allow authors to manipulate displayed dates (affecting both websites and RSS feeds), they often overlook the timestamps of static resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your task:</strong> Check the HTTP Last-Modified headers of the image files to discover when they were actually uploaded. Compare these timestamps to the claimed publication dates to identify discrepancies.
          </p>
          <p class="hint" style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9rem;">
            Hint: Use the network inspector in your browser's developer tools or make HTTP HEAD requests to check the Last-Modified headers of the images. This technique works because most users don't alter the timestamps of static resources when backdating content.
