With the fundamentals of both static and dynamic content scraping under our belt, it's time to tackle a more comprehensive challenge: multi-page crawling. This section focuses on efficiently navigating and extracting data from websites with multiple interconnected pages.

There are two main approaches to crawling multi-page websites:

1. Link-based crawling - Following links between pages
2. Sitemap-based crawling - Using the sitemap.xml file

For sitemap crawling, most websites provide a sitemap.xml file that lists all important URLs. This structured XML file includes:

- Page URLs
- Last modified dates
- Change frequency
- Priority values

Using the sitemap can be more efficient than link crawling since it:
- Provides a complete list of pages upfront
- Includes metadata about page importance and freshness
- Avoids crawling unnecessary pages
- Reduces server load

But for this chapter, we'll focus on link-based crawling using Crawlee to build a crawler for a multi-page e-commerce site. Crawlee handles many of the complexities of web crawling for us, including:

- Automatic queue management and URL deduplication
- Built-in rate limiting and retry logic
- Configurable request handling and routing
- Data storage and export

The site structure we'll be crawling looks like this:

```
Homepage
├── Category: Electronics
│   ├── Phones
│   ├── Laptops
│   └── Accessories
├── Category: Clothing
│   ├── Men's
│   └── Women's
└── Featured Products
```

Each product page has different layouts depending on the category, but we need to extract consistent information:

```typescript
// Example data structure we want to build
interface ProductData {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  rating: { score: number, count: number };
  features: string[];
  status: string; // In Stock, Out of Stock, etc.
}

interface ResultData {
  categories: {
    electronics: {
      phones: ProductData[];
      laptops: ProductData[];
      accessories: ProductData[];
    };
    clothing: {
      mens: {
        shirts: ProductData[];
        pants: ProductData[];
      };
      womens: {
        dresses: ProductData[];
        tops: ProductData[];
      };
    };
  };
  featured_products: FeaturedProduct[];
}
```

### Key Crawling Concepts with Crawlee

1. **Request Queue Management**

Crawlee handles the queue automatically, but here's how we configure it:

```typescript
import { CheerioCrawler } from 'crawlee';

const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    // Handles each request
    async requestHandler({ $, request, enqueueLinks }) {
        // Process the page
        const data = extractPageData($);

        // Automatically queue new URLs found on the page
        await enqueueLinks({
            selector: 'a',
            baseUrl: request.loadedUrl,
        });
    },
    // Limit concurrent requests
    maxConcurrency: 10,
});
```

2. **URL Handling**

Crawlee provides built-in URL handling and normalization:

```typescript
await crawler.run([startUrl]);

// Or with more configuration:
await crawler.addRequests([{
    url: startUrl,
    userData: {
        label: 'start',
    },
}]);
```

3. **Route Handling**

Route different URLs to specific handlers:

```typescript
const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ $, request }) {
        const { label } = request.userData;

        switch (label) {
            case 'category':
                return handleCategory($);
            case 'product':
                return handleProduct($);
            default:
                return handleHomepage($);
        }
    },
});
```

4. **Data Collection**

Crawlee provides built-in storage for collected data:

```typescript
const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ $, pushData }) {
        const productData = extractProduct($);
        await pushData(productData);
    },
});
```

### Web Crawling Best Practices

While Crawlee handles many low-level concerns, you should still consider:

1. **Configuration**
   - Set appropriate rate limits
   - Configure retry strategies
   - Set meaningful user-agent strings

2. **Error Handling**
   - Use Crawlee's built-in error handling
   - Implement custom error callbacks
   - Log meaningful diagnostic information

3. **Data Organization**
   - Structure your data consistently
   - Use request labels for routing
   - Leverage Crawlee's dataset features

4. **Resource Management**
   - Configure maxConcurrency appropriately
   - Use maxRequestsPerCrawl when needed
   - Monitor memory usage

### The Challenge

Your task is to build a Crawlee-based crawler that:

1. Starts at the homepage and discovers all product categories
2. Visits each category and subcategory page
3. Extracts product information from each listing
4. Organizes data into a structured format
5. Handles products that appear in multiple places (e.g., featured and category)

The site contains approximately 25-30 products across different categories, with varying layouts and information structures. Your crawler should produce a comprehensive dataset that maintains the hierarchical relationship between categories and products.

### Testing Your Solution

Test for:
- Completeness: Did you find all products?
- Accuracy: Is the extracted data correct?
- Structure: Is the data organized properly?
- Efficiency: How many requests did you make?

The solved example in `_solved/chapter6/` provides a reference implementation using Crawlee. Study it to understand how to leverage the library's features for efficient multi-page crawling and data organization.

Happy crawling!
